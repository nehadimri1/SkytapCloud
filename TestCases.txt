Story: Using REST API write a code to Run, Suspend, Resume, Stop the environment 

As a User 
I want to Run, suspend, Resume, stop VM using API.

Scenario 1: Running  Stopped VM
Given A Stopped VM 
And A sample project  that  already has the above JSON API
When I call above API with runstate=running
Then VM is started and in Running state

Scenario 2: Suspend a Running VM
Given Running VM 
And A sample project that already has JSON API
When I Write
Then VM is in Suspended state.

Scenario 3: Stopping a Running VM
Given Running VM 
And A sample project that already has JSON API
When I Write
Then VM is in stopped state.

Scenario 4: Restarting a suspended VM
Given Running VM 
And A sample project that already has JSON API
When I Write
Then VM is in stopped state.

Scenario 5: VM is not starting
Given Stopped VM
And A sample project that already has JSON API
When I tried to Run the VM
Then It gives the error “The operation cannot be performed at this time. Please try again or contact support.”

Scenario 6: Suspended VM can’t be stop
Given A VM in Suspended state
When I tried to stop That
Then “Error message will be displayed”


Scenario 6: No action is performed if the status is “Busy” 
Given VM is in Suspended State
When I tried any operation “Stop”,” Start”, Suspend”
Then No action is performed

Given A VM is Running 
When  No action is performed for 30 mins
